Angular-ChocolateChip-UI
========================

This is a library of Angular directives that implement the ChocolateChip-UI framework. This provides the same great support for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8 with a native look and feel for your Angular app. This is especially important if you wish to use Angular to create a hybrid app that you can deploy to the app stores for these platforms.
